NestedFlow Automation is a graphical, flow chart linke Test automation framework to build scalable, reusable, cheaper automation test cases and easily manage them

# What is Test Automation Framework
It is a group of components that work towards executing test cases and facilitate comprehensive reporting of test results

# Constituents of Test Automation Framework
- AUtomation technology that will help operate UI and other components
- Object Spy to capture testable component properties
- Object information management
- Object Reusability
- Integration with other technology
- Reporting Mechaism
- Integration with Test management tool
- Support multiple development methodology
- AI features
- Test Data management

# Automation Technology
- Tool uses Windows automation framework for automation of windows dektop components
- Uses Java Access bridge to automate legacy Java desktop objects

# Modernization and Extension
- Easy to reuse components
- Test cases look like flow chart so easy to understand and maintain
- Centralized object Repo
- Integration with GitHub
- File/database or Github based script storage
- Supports C# scripting to support extended scenarios
- Command line execution
- Parallel Execution Of Test Cases

# Development Methodology
- Supports BDD,keyword or Data driven approaches

# Play and Record
- Tool doesnt provide traditional record and play instead it provides the reverse. Simulation of action on screen so that the derived script is correct the first time itself without much modifications
